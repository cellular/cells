/**
 This classes aim is to smoothen the progress reports of a seekable live stream to view and tracking delegates.
 The initial situation is, that the observing of seekable live streams,  which are played in the `AVPLayer` with
 the common approach to `addPeriodicTimeObserver` and checking `AVItem`'s
 `seekableTimeRanges` (`start` and `duration`), and use this results un-processed  leads
 to irregular results and inconsistent playhead / progress reportings. The exact shaping of the effect depends on
 variable properties of the stream, like chunksize and size of the seekable range.

 To get independent of different streams and situations, this class  models a status, which is more stable.
 The idea is, to init or reset a`SeekableLiveStreamStatus` object whenever a new live stream is
 started and then update this object with a periodic time observer.
